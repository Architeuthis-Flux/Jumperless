This is a new revision of [breadWare](https://github.com/Architeuthis-Flux/breadWare) with a new name. 

That repo has a lot more info that generally applies to this one too, so go read that if you'd like to know more about this thing. 

I'm basically rewriting that whole codebase from scratch because it's kind of a mess. So the new stuff will go here. 

## Here's the general vague roadmap (for anyone who wants to contribute):

An Arduino library for commanding the RP2040

A circuitPython library to do connection stuff.

(optional) a custom GUI for making connections

(optional) Component placement sensing or just a simple way to define part locations
