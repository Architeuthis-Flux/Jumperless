# This is the launcher for OSX, this way the app will be opened
# when you double click it from the apps folder
open /Applications/jumperlesswokwibridge.app/Contents/MacOS/jumperlesswokwibridge_cli



#this should be called jumperlesswokwibridge in the contents folder of the app

#and the real app should be renamed to jumperlesswokwibridge_cli

#it's a hack to allow you to both have a .app file and actually run it in a persistent Terminal
